/**
 * @brief Section 8 Challenge
 * For this program, I'm going to be using US dollars and cents
 *
 * Write a program that asks the user to enter the following:
 * An integer representing the number of cents
 *
 * You can assume that the number of cents entered is greater than or equal to zero.
 *
 * The program then displays how to provide that change to the user.
 *
 * In the U.S:
 *     1 dollar = 100 cents
 *     1 quarter = 25 cents
 *     1 dime = 10 cents
 *     1 nickel = 5 cents
 *     1 penny = 1 cent
 *
 * Example
 * Enter an amount in cents: 92
 *
 * You can provide this change as follows:
 * dollars  : 0
 * quarters : 3
 * dime     : 1
 * nickel   : 1
 * pennies  : 2
 *
