/**
 * @brief Challenge 19.3
 *
 * Challenge 3
 * Word finder
 *
 * Ask the user to enter a word
 * Process the Romeo and Juliet file and determine how many total words there are
 * and how many times the word the user entered appears as a substring of a word in the play.
 *
 * For example.
 * If the user enters: love
 * Then the words love, lovely, and beloved will all be considered matches.
 * You decide whether you want to be case sensitive or not. My solution is case sensitive
 *
 * Sample are some sample runs:
 *
 * Enter the substring to search for: love
 * 25919 words were searched...
 * The substring love was found 171 times
 *
 * Enter the substring to search for: Romeo
 * 25919 words were searched...
 * The substring Romeo was found 132 times
 *
 * Enter the substring to search for: Juliet
 * 25919 words were searched...
 * The substring Juliet was found 49 times
 *
 * Enter the substring to search for: Frank
 * 25919 words were searched...
 * The substring Frank was found 0 times
 *
