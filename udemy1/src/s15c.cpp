/*
 * Section 15: Challenge - Inheritance challenge
 * =============================================
 * You are provided with a simple Account class hierarchy that contains
 * Account - Base class
 * Savings Account - Derived class
 *
 * An Account has a name and a balance.
 * A Savings Account is an Account and adds an interest rate.
 *
 * I have also provided some Account helper functions in Account_Util.h and Account_Util.cpp
 * that make it easy to display, deposit to, and withdraw from a vector of Accounts and Savings Accounts.
 *
 * Please refer to the source code provided and the video explanation of this challenge for more details.
 *
 * Your challenge is the following:
 *
 * 1. Add a Checking account class to the Account hierarchy
 *     A Checking account has a name and a balance and has a fee of $1.50 per withdrawal transaction.
 *     Every withdrawal transaction will be assessed this flat fee.
 *
 * 2. Add a Trust account class to the Account hierarchy
 *     A Trust account has a name, a balance, and an interest rate
 *     The Trust account deposit works just like a savings account deposit.
 *     However, any deposits of $5000.00 or more will receive a $50.00 bonus deposited to the account.
 *
 *     The Trust account withdrawal should only allow 3 withdrawals per year and each of these must be less than 20% of
 * the account balance. You don't have to keep track of calendar time for this application, just make sure the 4th
 * withdrawal fails :)
 *
 * Hints:
 *     Reuse existing functionality!!
 *     Think about what the Base class will be for the new classes.
 *     Add helper functions to Account_Util.h and Account_Util.cpp if you wish to work with your new classes.
 *     (You don't have to, but it will make your main much easier to use)
 *
 * Have fun!!  You are no longer beginner C++ programmers!
 *
 * If you want more practice with operator overloading you can overload += and -= for deposit and withdrawal :)
 *
